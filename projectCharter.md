The project client is Scout Association of Slovenia

## 3. Purpose and objective of the project
The purpose of this project is to establish a new and improved archive management system for the Scout Association of Slovenia. The objective is for the whole association to want to use the product.

## 4. Description of the fiished product
The volunteer scout organization must submit many different reports at the end of each year (activity report, patrol work report, function report, club report, financial report, and work plan for the following year) about the past year. Currently, the reports are submitted in several different formats (PDF, Word, Google Forms, physical paper), which are then stored on Google Drive and in a physical folder for bookkeeping. As a result, the archive is disorganized and inconsistent, making it difficult to search through.

Everybody reports directly to team lead - Gregor Ahlin.

The shipping deadline for the finished project is 22nd Feb 2027.
