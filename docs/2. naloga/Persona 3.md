## Andrej the Treasurer

**Screening Question:**  
Are you responsible for managing your scout unit’s finances and submitting the annual financial report?

**Persona Description:**

Andrej Kovač is 35 and works as an electrical technician. In scouts, he volunteers as the unit treasurer. He usually wears practical clothes and his scout shirt at meetings. He brings his personal laptop when he needs to do administrative work.

He keeps track of the unit’s income and expenses in a simple Excel spreadsheet. Most of the year he only updates it occasionally, but at the end of the year he has to prepare and submit the financial report. He usually does this at home in the evening.

Andrej is comfortable using basic computer tools like email, spreadsheets, and websites, but he doesn’t want to deal with complicated systems. Since reporting only happens once a year, he often forgets where to submit the report or how it worked last time. He just wants a simple place where he can upload the report and know it’s done.

He also sometimes needs to check old financial reports, for example to compare expenses or reuse information. Right now, those files are usually somewhere in his email or on his computer, and it can take time to find them.

**Thinks**

- “I just want to upload the report and finish this.”
- “Where did I save last year’s report?”
- “I hope I’m submitting the right file.”

**Sees**

- Financial files stored in different folders and emails
- No single clear place where everything is stored

**Feels**

- Responsible for submitting correct financial data
- Slightly annoyed by administrative work
- Relieved when the report is submitted

**Does**

- Uses Excel to track finances
- Prepares and submits one financial report per year
- Searches old emails or folders to find past reports
- Works on reports at home on his laptop
